This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid user IDs.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version with proper error handling.  This bug can lead to unexpected behavior such as crashes or incorrect responses if the `userId` parameter is not a valid number or if the user is not found.  The solution implements thorough checks and sends appropriate HTTP error responses.
